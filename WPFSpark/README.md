WPFSpark is an open source project, which I started in December 2009, with the aim of creating a library of rich user controls which can be used by the developer community. Initially, I ported the Circular Progress Control (which I had developed using C# and GDI+) to WPF. Eventually, as I gained more experience in WPF, I added more controls.

WPFSpark v1.0 was released in December 2011 followed by WPFSpark v1.1 in January 2012. Now, after a really long gap of nearly 4 years, I am happy to announce that the next version of WPFSpark is finally released. :) It has been ported to .NET 4.6 using C# 6.0.
